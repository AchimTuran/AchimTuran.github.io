{"name":"Achim's project portfolio","tagline":"","body":"### [LXC (LibXConvolver)](https://github.com/AchimTuran/LibXConvolver)\r\nLXC is a highly optimized cross platform open source library for [fast convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Convolution#Fast_convolution_algorithms). The library has a simple API, which can be used for real application, prototyping or as a tutorial on how to use the included functions to develop more complex applications.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### [asplib (Achim's Signal Processing LIBrary)](https://github.com/AchimTuran/asplib/)\r\nThis is my cross platform C/C++ signal processing library. At the moment it includes the following features:\r\n- A cross platform biquad filter class with factory design pattern to create filters with different processor optimizations\r\n- Frame buffer, frame ring buffer and normal buffer implementations through a C/C++ template class interface\r\n- An easy to use PortAudio interface class for rapid prototyping of C/C++ audio processing algorithms\r\n- The project is still under development and features where constanly added from time to time. For more informations just follow this [link](https://github.com/AchimTuran/asplib/) to my github.com repository.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### [adsp.template](https://github.com/AchimTuran/adsp.template)\r\nIt's a framework for developing new audio add-ons for Kodi's new Audio DSP extension point. I'm still improving the code during development of adsp.biquad.filters and adsp.xconvolver. After both add-ons are finished I will update the (doxygen documentation](http://wisler.bplaced.de/xbmc-adsp-addons/) of it.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### adsp.xconvolver\r\nadsp.xconvolver is convolution engine addon for Kodi's audio processing system. It's based on [LibXConvolver](https://github.com/AchimTuran/LibXConvolver) and [asplib](https://github.com/AchimTuran/asplib/). \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### adsp.biquad.filters\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n### My Google Summer of Code project [Creating cross-platform room correction for Kodi](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/public/google/gsoc2015/achim_turan/5629499534213120)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
