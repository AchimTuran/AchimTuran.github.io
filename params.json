{"name":"Achim's project portfolio","tagline":"","body":"### [LXC (LibXConvolver)](https://github.com/AchimTuran/LibXConvolver)\r\nLXC is a highly optimized cross platform open source library for [fast convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Convolution#Fast_convolution_algorithms). The library has a simple API, which can be used for real application, prototyping or as a tutorial on how to use the included functions to develop more complex applications.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### [asplib (Achim's Signal Processing LIBrary)](https://github.com/AchimTuran/asplib/)\r\nThis is my cross platform C/C++ signal processing library. At the moment it includes the following features:\r\n- A cross platform biquad filter class with factory design pattern to create filters with different processor optimizations\r\n- Frame buffer, frame ring buffer and normal buffer implementations through a C/C++ template class interface\r\n- An easy to use PortAudio interface class for rapid prototyping of C/C++ audio processing algorithms\r\n- The project is still under development and features where constanly added from time to time. For more informations just follow this [link](https://github.com/AchimTuran/asplib/) to my github.com repository.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### [adsp.template](https://github.com/AchimTuran/adsp.template)\r\nIt's a framework and starting point for developing new audio add-ons for Kodi's new Audio DSP extension point. I'm still improving the code during the development of adsp.biquad.filters and adsp.xconvolver.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### [adsp.xconvolver](https://github.com/AchimTuran/adsp.xconvolver)\r\nadsp.xconvolver is convolution engine addon for Kodi's audio processing system. It's based on [LibXConvolver](https://github.com/AchimTuran/LibXConvolver), [adsp.template](https://github.com/AchimTuran/adsp.template) and [asplib](https://github.com/AchimTuran/asplib/).\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### [adsp.biquad.filters](https://github.com/AchimTuran/adsp.biquad.filters)\r\nThis project is also for Kodi's audio processing system. At the moment it only contains 10 band equalizer to adjust the frequency band levels.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### My Google Summer of Code 2015 project\r\nThe project has the name[Creating cross-platform room correction for Kodi](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/public/google/gsoc2015/achim_turan/5629499534213120) and wants to optimize the audio itself during playback to perfectly fit into the environment of the listener. If you want to follow the progress on the project see my [weekly reports](http://achim-turan.de/gsoc-blog/weekly-reports/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
